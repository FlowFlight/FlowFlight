### Description
This project aims to develop an advanced artificial intelligence algorithm designed to assist air traffic controllers in making efficient and effective decisions regarding the sequencing of aircraft for landing and departure. The primary goal is to handle disruptions, such as delays, that can upset the entire schedule, thereby optimizing overall airport operations.


### Project Objectives

1. Optimize Aircraft Sequencing During Delays

    - **Dynamic Adjustment:** The algorithm will dynamically adjust the sequence of aircraft for takeoff and landing when a delay occurs. By analyzing real-time data, it can quickly identify the optimal order to maintain smooth airport operations.
    - **Prioritization:** It will prioritize flights based on various factors, such as connection times, aircraft type, and airline schedules, to minimize the overall impact of the delay on the system.
    - **Efficiency:** By optimizing the sequence, the algorithm ensures that the airspace and runway usage are maximized, reducing waiting times and improving overall efficiency.

2. Minimize Delay Costs for Airlines and Airports

    - **Cost Analysis:** The algorithm will incorporate cost analysis, taking into account the financial impact of delays on airlines and airport operations. This includes fuel costs, crew costs, passenger compensation, and potential revenue loss.
    - **Resource Allocation:** It will optimize resource allocation, ensuring that the most cost-effective decisions are made regarding the deployment of gates, ground crew, and other operational aspects.
    - **Proactive Measures:** By predicting potential delays and their impact, the algorithm can suggest proactive measures to mitigate costs, such as re-routing flights or adjusting gate assignments.

3. Reduce Decision-Making Burden on Air Traffic Controllers

    - **Automated Recommendations:** The algorithm will provide real-time, automated recommendations to air traffic controllers, reducing their decision-making burden. This allows controllers to focus on critical tasks and overall safety.
    - **Error Reduction:** With the algorithm handling routine and complex sequencing tasks, the risk of human error decreases. This leads to safer and more reliable airport operations.
    - **Enhanced Situational Awareness:** By presenting clear, data-driven recommendations, the algorithm enhances controllers' situational awareness, enabling them to make more informed decisions when necessary.

### Benefits of the Project
  - **Improved Operational Efficiency:** Reduced waiting times and increased throughput, leading to more efficient airport operations.
  - **Cost Savings:** Lower costs for airlines and airports due to minimized delays and optimized resource use.
  - **Enhanced Safety and Reliability:** Reduced decision-making burden on air traffic controllers, leading to fewer errors and safer operations.
  - **Better Passenger Experience:** Smoother flight operations and fewer delays, resulting in higher passenger satisfaction.
